# Project Title

Week 1 Assesement - Craft Academy.

# Problem Statement
* Create a new folder called `cars` and inside of that folder, create a file called `car.rb` with:
1. a class Car
2. a method to "paint" a car a new color.
* Open irb. Load your 'car.rb' file. Create an instance of a `Car` and change its color.
* Create a unit test for our `Car` class to test our "painting" method.
* A car should have a driver. Create an `instance_double` `Driver`.  Write a second test for this and make it pass.
